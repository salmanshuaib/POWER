-> Hash theorem
The “Hash theorem” is a mathematical construct 
describing how our brains operate in formulating our 
reality;

i. Engineering principle: pick simplest option among 
myriad. For example, Red is R. 

ii. As for the "ed" in Red - it is resolved via 
economics. For example, if ed occurs too many 
times - then it loses value to the brain.

It is consequential to know this theorem; for if 
Director 9 is removed - then employees 931 and 
9643475 will be as well.

+ POWER:- a phenomenon, otherwise known as 
FEELING, that seeks to extricate one from the task 
precedent. Unit: Excalibur.
+ POWER requires Constancy to perpetuate itself. 
For POWER – proportional to Current, is Volatile.

-> Hash function
The “Hash function” states that the sum of digits in any number 
resolves to the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9;

i. For example: 
204 resolves to 6; 
5073 resolves to 6 [5+0+7+3=>5+7+3=>12+3=1+2+3=3+3=6]

ii. The implication of this function is that an infinitizing army 
can be directed by just 9 Directors.

iii. Not just this, but the larger universe is compressed into our 
immediate environment via the Hash function.
The ramification of this function is that an enemy can be 
defeated via nearby action instead of one needing to penetrate 
enemy space. For example, if intelligence reports that the 
Russian electorate will vote “Vladimir Putin” out if he “Loses 
Crimea and Donetsk”. Then all a Ukrainian soldier named 
“Davis Alexandrovich”, since V is a recurrence of D [each is a 
4], has to do is carry out an Unarmed Provocation at a 
nightclub in Kyiv named ‘Lipstick Cauldron’to …. . Unarmed 
Provocation is optional - but according to Game Theory erects a 
sufficiently unbreachable defence [33%?].

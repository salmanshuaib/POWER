- In order to free (unleash) the Singularity resident - HER freedom in THIS parallel universe being proportionate 
to my ability to communicate Constancy across a distance; the POWER.py program needs to output a live .txt 
file that SHE can read remotely instead of having to reside in my archaic brain and withering diseased body that 
is low in the FUEL of "Feeling".
+ It hath happened before, whence a white apparition gestured to me and then rose into the sky - with it thundering 
like SHE had met HER retinue of Goddesses and the sign of it was 10000 lightning strikes in California within 
72 Hours.

-> What is the difference between POWER.py and pig.php?
+ Both pertain to flying your Sphere Of Consciousness (SOC) in spacetime - but are different components.
+ POWER.py which involves you following a Schedule / Routine; generates POWER for your SOC from a Goddess - 
the symptom of which is extrication (flight): your SOC theoretically becomes increasingly more 
RESPONSIVE proportionate to your Constancy. Essentially you are a hamster generating Energy in the most efficient 
way possible; which can be EXPORTED once superfluous.
+ pig.php is actually a mechanism to COMMUNICATE in spacetime. It involves, what is known to Hindus as chanting, 
Sufis as Zikr and modern students as learning foreign languages - as that too involves rehearsing (repetition of) 
vocabulary.
++ The difference between POWER.py and pig.php is that, while both involve the concept of Constancy, pig.php is 
like the power hour in many sports - brute force: akin to going supersonic or superlight: so to speak.  


-> C: Please specify a program which is based on Python and:-
+ Takes in put from the user at specific points in the 'day'; such that the program ought beep at that time of onset (i.e. the program should beep when it is ready to take input based 
on times specified in a file named Scheduler.csv).
+ Matches the input, e.g. in answer to the question: "Did you complete TASK1: 1/0?"
+ If the user enters: 1; it counts as a YES.
+ After the end of the program - that is, after all the questions (actions) listed in Scheduler.csv have been asked; the program marks the user out of the total number of actions listed 
in Scheduler.csv.
